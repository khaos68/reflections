What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden directory (.git) is added to the working directory. To git to be able to track all the changes to the files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area only has the files to be commited. The working area has all the actual files and the repository has the version-controlles files grouped in commits.
