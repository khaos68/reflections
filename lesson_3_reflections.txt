When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when I work from different computers or when more people are expected to work on the same files.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might be working on a branch with other people and I likely will not desire that a change in a particular file in the remote repository automatically update a file I am working on.
