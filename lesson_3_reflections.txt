When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when I work from different computers or when more people are expected to work on the same files.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might be working on a branch with other people and I likely will not desire that a change in a particular file in the remote repository automatically update a file I am working on. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork, when the branch of other user is cloned to my account leaving a trace of the original creator.
Clone, when a branch of other user is copied without leaving trace of the original branch.
Branch, a group of related commits. Starting in the "tip" and following the child/father relation until the initial commmit.

Fork would be used when I want to start a branch based in the work of other user. "Cloning his branch in my repository leaving a trace to the original creator.
Clone should be used when I want to copy a branch to my computer.
Branch is used to create a branch from the original branch to start working in possible change independently from the original branch.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

That I can make compares (diff / status) while being offline against the remote branch.
